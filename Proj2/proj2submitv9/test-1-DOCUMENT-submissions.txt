Mary had a little lamb

a classic rhyme of 19th-century origin in America,       
has remained a popular verse over the course of time and is still a very relevant   
piece of American culture.   .   This paper will examine why this rhyme has remained    
relevant as well as endeavor to contextualize it for a     modern audience; we will
also examine ways to alter the original text, in unobtrusive ways, to bring out
the original meaning.	 . .   . Mary 			had a little lamb!

Mary had a little lamb

These are    	the words repeated by people when they endeavor to sing this old
children'   s rhyme. Mary had a little lamb     . Mary had a little lamb!! ! ! ! !    !! Mary had a
little lamb. Why not repeat one of the other lines? Are we so fickle that we

           

don't   		    recall even the second line of such a classic piece   ?   Whose fleece was white
as snow! Whose fleece was white as snow! Why do we not repeat this line instead   ?
