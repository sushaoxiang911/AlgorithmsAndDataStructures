Mary had a little lamb

These are the words repeated by people when they endeavor to sing this old
children's rhyme. Mary had a little lamb. Mary had a little lamb. Mary had a
little lamb. Why not repeat one of the other lines? Are we so fickle that we
don't recall even the second line of such a classic piece? Whose fleece was white
as snow! Whose fleece was white as snow! Why do we not repeat this line instead?
